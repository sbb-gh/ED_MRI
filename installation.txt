Helper file to install required parackages.

Running JOFSTO requires:
    - pytorch
    - numpy

Running the jupyter notebook examples further requires:
    - notebook

The code can run on GPU or on the CPU only (much slower).
Please see [link](https://pytorch.org/) for PyTorch installation details.

We have run the code with multiple versions of python, pytorch, and numpy, but of course we haven't tested them all! 
The main results in the paper were generated with python=3.6.13, pytorch==1.4.0, numpy==1.19.4, running on GPU with cuda 10.1, gcc 8.3.

Examples in our code may require additional packages, e.g. for simuating data.

We recommend running the code in a virtual environment. There are multiple options for creating environments and installing the requirements:
    - Use conda [link](https://docs.conda.io) e.g. 
        $ conda create -n ED_MRI
        $ conda install torch numpy notebook
    - Use pyenv [link](https://github.com/pyenv) and pip e.g. 
        $ python -m venv ED_MRI_env           
        $ source ED_MRI_env/bin/activate
        $ pip install numpy torch notebook
