Stefano
- Overview for text files -> Also do in MATLAB
- High-level example of data format, in tutorial and readme, maybe better to have examples ??
- Cleanup JOFSTO, remove unncecessary fluff, add accessability to sections
- Option in-training noramlizations, currently only affine.  Descripti/tutorial on of normalization?
- Explain data normalization concisely, normalization in MRI implies different channels have different statistics.
- Option to save network, instructions on how to load and use
[-Code automated cleanup (black, PEP8)]

Paddy
- Add comments to utils/simulations.py -- maybe split the file into two?
- Consider matlab example where you save the data output and load JOFSTO
- Give advice on what

Both
- Discuss how to integrate MATLAB into library
- MATLAB-only version -- (i) Call python from MATLAB, (ii) Implement JOFSTO from MATLAB
