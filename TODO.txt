- High-level example of data format, in tutorial and readme, maybe better to have examples ??
- Cleanup JOFSTO, remove unncecessary fluff, add accessability to sections
- Last cell in tutorial, normalization
[- TODO code automated cleanup (black, PEP8)]

Paddy
- Add comments to utils/simulations.py -- maybe split the file into two?
- Consider matlab example where you save the data output and load JOFSTO
- Speak to Lizzie
