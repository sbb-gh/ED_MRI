This contains extensions and adaptations of original CRLB code by Ben Jeurissen. Adapted by Paddy Slator p.slator@ucl.ac.uk.

The original code was described as below.

Simple MATLAB demo that show how CRLB can be used for optimal experimental design of diffusion MRI.

This demo complements the talk "Acquisition Approaches: From Basic to Advanced", given at the [ISMRM 2022 Workshop on Diffusion MRI: From Research to Clinic in Amsterdam, The Netherlands](https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2022/Diffusion/#inline-program).
